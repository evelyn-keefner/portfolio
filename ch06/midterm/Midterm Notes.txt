**Changeable Parameters** 

Initial Trunk Size
  Self explanatory
Branch Frequency
  chance of more branches being generated than not
Branch Size Decay
  As each iteration goes through this determines how small they get. Branch width will be determined off of branch length using a set function
Leaf Frequency
  Chance of a leaf being generated on small branches
Branch Leaf Frequency
  Chance of a leaf being generated on a branch of any size
Degree Range
  The range of degrees that the next branch will be angled out
Degree Growth Factor
  Whether or not you want the range of the branches to increase as the interations progress


Tree Function
  Trunk Function
  Branches
    As the branch is being drawn, as each step advances there will be a chance for a smaller branch to be drawn off of it
    When the branch gets small enough nearing the top of the tree, the leaf frequency will be used to determine whether or not leaves will be generated on it
    Leaves 
      Each branch of any size as it is being drawn has a chance to have leaves drawn along it
