# Chapter 1: Data

- Algorithms doesn't change

- Data will change

## RULE #1: Separate things that change from things that stay the same


Algorithms end with parenthesis, sometimes with arguments

Algorithms => Functions

print()

ALL data has a type and value

1, int
"1", str
1.0, float


# Review: Data Type

- Data
  - Type: int
  - Value: 64
  - Type: str
  - Value: 'A' (64)

  Duck Type Language:

  1 (int)
  1 (str)




# Rule #2

- Don't Repeat Yourself
  - Keep your code DRY

## Variables

- A memory bucket to hold data
- It's a named address

- Variable names
  - must start with a letter
    - should be lowercase
    - spaces respresent with a _, my_var
    - letters, numbers, and underscores
    - reserved words:
      - `class, True, for`


- int
- float
- str

- container types
  - list
    - contains a list of data objects
    - they do not have to be the same type
